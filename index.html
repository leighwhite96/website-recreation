    <h2>The Road to Enlightenment</h2>
    <br>
    Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags,<br> incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and abandoned browsers.<br>
    <br>
    We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to <br> the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WaSP, and the major browser creators.<br>
    <br>
    The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of<br> the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in<br> new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.

    <h2>So What is This About?</h2>
    <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. <br> The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage<br> participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs<br> in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet<br> into this very page. The HTML remains the same, the<br> only thing that has changed is the external CSS file. Yes,<br> really.
    <br>
    <br>
    CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a<br> hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated <br>in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating <br>what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the<br> hands of those able to create beauty from structure.<br> Designers and coders alike have contributed to the <br>beauty of the web; we can always push it further.<br></p>

      <h2>Participation</h2>
      Strong visual design has always been our focus. You <br> are modifying this page, so strong CSS skills are <br>necessary too, but the example files are commented<br> well enough that even CSS novices can use them as<br> starting points. Please see the CSS Resource Guide for <br> advanced tutorials and tips on working with CSS.<br>
      <br>
      You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but<br> not the HTML. This may seem daunting at first if you’ve<br> never worked this way before, but follow the listed links<br> to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.<br>
      <br>
      Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy <br> locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece <br> (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload <br> your CSS file to a web server under your control. Send <br> us a link to an archive of that file and all associated <br> assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it<br> and place it on our server.<br>

      Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4 should be <br>limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided.<br> The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical CSS and not the latest bleeding-<br>edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we <br>have is that your CSS validates.<br>
      <br>
      Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented<br> CSS by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results<br> across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web<br> these days — especially when you factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not<br> be possible across every platform. That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can.<br> Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and <br>Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).<br>
      <br>
      We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please <br>keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and <br>interesting visual themes to your work. We’re well past the point of needing another <br>garden-related design.<br>
      <br>
      This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on <br>your graphics (with limited exceptions, see submission guidelines), but we ask you <br>release your CSS under a Creative Commons license identical to the one on this site <br> so that others may learn from your work.<br>
